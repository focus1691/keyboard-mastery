# Keyboard Mastery

Keyboard Mastery is a unique word game that challenges your typing skills and knowledge of the keyboard layout. The objective is to strategically position words based on their corresponding keyboard rows, and earn points similar to the classic game Scrabble.

Instructions:

1. Words are placed in their keyboard row position.
  > row 1 qwertyuiop
  
  > row 2 asdfghjkl
  
  > row 3 zxcvbnm
  
2. Points are determined by their letter value, similar to Scrabble.
3. Blocks are destroyed when all 3 rows have an equal number of blocks, and the points are added to the total.
4. The game ends if either of the three rows spans beyond the maximum row size and not cleared.
